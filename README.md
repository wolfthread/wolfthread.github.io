# Developer Portfolio

This is my portfolio, which you can view [here](https://sylvaindessureault.com).

Built and customized following Brad Traversy's [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/). I added a few functionalities in the [typewriter code](js/typewriter.js) in order to have some variations on the ways the words are deleted on the page.

For a reference on Brad's original verion, [see here](js/typewriter_original.js).

## Re Design

I'm currently working on re-designing my portfolio, so stay tuned for updates.
